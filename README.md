## Experiment 1: Live Character Counter

### Course Outcome Mapped
**CO1** – Explain the fundamental concepts of front-end development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Aim
To implement a live character counter that updates as users type in a text area.

### Objectives
- Create a responsive text input component
- Implement real-time character counting
- Add visual feedback for character limits
- Style the interface using modern CSS techniques

### Hardware / Software Requirements
- **Software:** VS Code, Web Browser (Chrome)
- **Hardware:** i3 Processor or above, 4GB RAM

### About the Program
This experiment demonstrates real-time UI updates using JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation.  
As the user types in the text area, the character count updates instantly, and visual feedback is provided when the maximum character limit is reached.

### Learning Outcomes
After completing this experiment, the student will be able to:
- Use HTML form elements effectively
- Implement real-time functionality using JavaScript events
- Manipulate the DOM dynamically
- Apply CSS for visual feedback and styling
- Understand frontend logic without backend dependency

## Experiment 2: Dynamic Product Filter

### Aim
To create a dynamic product filter that sorts items based on dropdown selection.

### Objectives
- Implement filterable product data
- Create a sortable dropdown user interface
- Display responsive product cards
- Animate layout transitions using CSS

### Hardware / Software Requirements
- **Software:** VS Code, Web Browser
- **Hardware:** Same as Experiment 1

### About the Program
This experiment demonstrates array manipulation and DOM-based rendering using JavaScript.  
Products are filtered dynamically based on user selection, and the layout adapts responsively using CSS Grid.

### Learning Outcomes
After completing this experiment, the student will be able to:
- Work with JavaScript arrays and objects
- Implement filtering logic using conditional statements
- Dynamically generate and update HTML elements
- Use CSS Grid for responsive layouts
- Understand how UI behavior changes based on user interaction

### Viva Voce Questions
1. Explain the auto-fill behavior in CSS Grid.
2. How would you implement multi-category filtering?
3. What is the purpose of using toFixed(2) for prices?
4. How could you add sorting by price or name?
5. Why are unique keys or identifiers important when rendering lists?

## Implementation Method

Both experiments are implemented within a **single HTML page** using:
- A sidebar/menu for navigation
- JavaScript-based dynamic content loading
- No page reloads (single-page behavior)

This approach ensures better user experience and efficient frontend design.
